# swarm

### requirements

`Ruby 2+`

### description

Squish or be squished!

### how-to-play

Use "VI cursor movement" keys "h" (left), "j" (down), "k" (up), "l" (right) to move
the Player around the Map. Rocks are immovable, push piles of Dirt
around to squish the Enemies - but don't let them squish you first!
